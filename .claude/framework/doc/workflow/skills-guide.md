# Skills Guide

Skills are **model-invoked** capabilities that Claude automatically activates based on context.

## What are Skills?

Unlike slash commands (which you invoke manually), Skills are:
- **Automatic**: Claude decides when to use them
- **Context-aware**: Activated based on your natural language request
- **Specialized**: Each Skill is an expert in its domain
- **Production-ready**: Generate high-quality, complete code

## Available Skills

## How Skills Activate

Skills use their **description** field to determine when to activate. Claude analyzes your request and matches it against Skill descriptions.

### Activation Flow

```
User: "Create a player health system"
    ‚Üì
Claude analyzes request
    ‚Üì
Matches: unity-component skill
    ‚Üì
Loads skill instructions
    ‚Üì
Generates MonoBehaviour component
    ‚Üì
Returns production-ready code
```

## Skills vs Commands Comparison

| Feature | Skills | Slash Commands |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Invocation** | Automatic by Claude | Manual by user (`/cmd`) |
| **Usage** | Natural language | Explicit command |
| **Flexibility** | High - adapts to context | Fixed - specific operation |
| **Discovery** | AI-driven | User must know command |
| **Best for** | Complex, contextual tasks | Quick, specific operations |

### Example Comparison

**Want to create a player controller:**

**Using Skill (Recommended):**
```
"I need a player controller with movement and jumping"
‚Üí Claude uses unity-component skill
‚Üí Generates complete controller with your requirements
```

**Using Command (Alternative):**
```
/component PlayerController HaroFramework.Player
‚Üí Generates basic component template
‚Üí You specify additional requirements separately
```

## Skill Files Structure

Each Skill is a directory in `.claude/skills/` containing:

```
.claude/skills/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # Required: Main instructions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reference.md       # Optional: Reference docs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples.md        # Optional: Code examples
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # Optional: Helper scripts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # Optional: Code templates
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when Claude should use it. This is critical for activation!
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
---

# Skill Name

## When to Use This Skill

Detailed activation criteria...

## Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for Claude...

## Best Practices

Guidelines and standards...

## Output Format

Expected output structure...
```

## Creating Custom Skills

### 1. Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
```

### 2. Create SKILL.md

**Good Description (activates reliably):**
```yaml
description: Create inventory systems with item management, storage, and UI integration. Use when implementing item collection, equipment, or crafting systems.
```

**Bad Description (won't activate):**
```yaml
description: Inventory stuff
```

### 3. Write Clear Instructions

Include:
- When to activate
- What to generate
- Code standards to follow
- Examples and patterns
- Output format expectations

### 4. Test Activation

Try natural language requests that should trigger your Skill:
- "Create an inventory system"
- "I need item management"
- "Build a crafting system"

## Best Practices

### For Skill Descriptions
1. **Include "What"**: What does this Skill do?
2. **Include "When"**: When should Claude use it?
3. **Be Specific**: Use domain keywords
4. **Keep Concise**: Max 1024 characters
5. **Use Examples**: Include use case examples

### For Skill Instructions
1. **Be Explicit**: Don't assume knowledge
2. **Provide Templates**: Include code structure
3. **Show Patterns**: Demonstrate conventions
4. **Explain Context**: Why things are done this way
5. **Include Validation**: How to verify correctness

### For Tool Restrictions
```yaml
# Read/write access (default)
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

# Read-only (for analysis skills)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob

# Specific tools only
allowed-tools: Read, Edit
```

## Progressive Context Loading

Claude loads Skill files progressively:
1. **SKILL.md** - Always loaded first
2. **reference.md** - Loaded when more detail needed
3. **examples.md** - Loaded when examples requested
4. **Other files** - Loaded on-demand

This optimizes token usage while maintaining rich context.

## Debugging Skills

### Skill Not Activating?

**Check:**
1. Description mentions relevant keywords
2. Description explains WHEN to use it
3. Skill name matches directory name
4. SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
5. Request uses domain terminology

### Skill Generates Wrong Output?

**Review:**
1. Instructions are clear and explicit
2. Code templates are correct
3. Examples match desired output
4. Context about project structure included
